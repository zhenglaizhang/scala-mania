## Play or Spray it

* Play has lots of cool things and we can use it to make a REST API, but Spray is exactly a framework to make REST APIs
* Spray “should” be faster since it’s more lightweight.

### No

 I think both options could result in an equally good project. Obviously, the choice depends on the team that will work with it and depends on the project features.
 
 * One of the main reasons to choose Akka-HTTP over Play could be performance (number of requests per second).
 * I found that Akka-HTTP is faster than Play, on average 6% faster.
 * I know that we cannot measure the performance of a framework just with one test scenario, but it gives me the idea that the performance could be very similar. 
 
 
 * Team experience
 * Team motivation
 * Project Features
    * Both frameworks support all kinds of authentication, but, maybe in Play, we have more options to do it.
 * Project Maintenance

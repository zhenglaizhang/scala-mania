/*
The MonadPlus type class is for monads that can also act as monoids.

Similar to Semigroup[A] and Monoid[A], Plus[F[_]] and PlusEmpty[F[_]] requires their instances to implement plus and empty, but at the type constructor ( F[_]) level.

Plus introduces <+> operator to append two containers:


MonadPlus introduces filter operation.
